README FOR SAFARI WATSON

IMPORTANT:
Please always create your own branch or work on the same branch together for modular coding practice. We need to keep our master very clean in order to make sure we have as few conflicts as possible. Be sure to SYNC FIRST, then do pull requests when you want to merge your code into master. 


TO RUN
------------
On your command prompt in the Education Game Directory:

python Egame.py


ECOLOGY
———————————
INSTANTIATE ECOLOGY IN GAME
self.ecology_1 = Ecology('lion', 'carnivore', self.screen, (300,40))

Get the location with
ecology_1.get_location()

Update the location when it’s moved with
ecology_1.update_location()

FOR DB
I need a call to get the questions I can ask the user if they click on the item

I need a way to edit the interest for the item in the DB once they’ve answered the question/s. 





DATABASE API
____________

AVAILABLE TABLES:

Profiles - Holds the profile names and question and interest data for each user

Questions - Holds the Question and Answer pairs, along with the ecology ID each question belongs to

---

print_QA_Pairs():

Prints all stored questions, along with their answers. (Debug only)

---

get_QA_Pair(int rowid):

Returns a question/answer tuple matching the given row/question number.

---

get_QAs(int e_id):

Returns a list of all question/answer tuples belonging to the given ecology ID.

---

remove_QA_Pair(rowid):

Removes the question/answer pair from the question pool at the given row.




ECOLOGY TABLE METHODS:

add_ecology(int id, str name, int tropic):

Adds a new species to the ecology table.

---

get_ecology_id(str name):

Returns the ID for a given species name.

---

get_ecology_name(int id):

Returns the name of a species given its ID.

---

get_ecology_tropic(int id):

Returns the tropic level of a species given its ID.

---

remove_ecology(int id):

Removes a species from the table given its ID.

---

print_ecology():

Prints a list of all species in the table. (Debug only)






OTHER METHODS:

commit_Changes():

In order to save data in the tables to persist across multiple sessions, you MUST use this command to save any changes.

---

close_Database():

Unneeded method, but acts as a safe way to close the database when exiting the game.
