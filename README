README FOR SAFARI WATSON

IMPORTANT:
Please always create your own branch or work on the same branch together for modular coding practice. We need to keep our master very clean in order to make sure we have as few conflicts as possible. Be sure to SYNC FIRST, then do pull requests when you want to merge your code into master. 


TO RUN
------------
On your command prompt in the Education Game Directory:

python Egame.py


ECOLOGY
———————————
INSTANTIATE ECOLOGY IN GAME
self.ecology_1 = Ecology('lion', 'carnivore', self.screen, (300,40))

Get the location with
ecology_1.get_location()

Update the location when it’s moved with
ecology_1.update_location()

FOR DB
I need a call to get the questions I can ask the user if they click on the item

I need a way to edit the interest for the item in the DB once they’ve answered the question/s.
